            "description": "CoreVest Finance meets the demand for affordable debt capital by a broad range of residential real estate investors. Interning as a data scientist in the summer of 2021, my partner and I built a profile persona of customers based on previously inaccessible application data using custom python scripts and OCR software. Using Random Forests, we created a model that predicted with 97.82% accuracy if a loan will be closed, withdrawn, or rejected. This information would not be known until months or years into the loan process.",

            "description": "The problem Uber faced was that the company’s pre-existing traffic estimates were wildly incorrect given the COVID-19 lockdown. This is interesting because solving the problem will save the company millions of dollars and allow us to reduce traffic congestion, which will help both the environment and save people time. We worked with multiple datasets from different sources in order to cluster data spatially using Google Plus Codes and census tract geojson to perform analysis on the impact COVID lockdown had on traffic in San Francisco. We built a time series model to account for the lockdown’s impact and was able to accurately predict travel time to different locations with 99.13% R2 score and RMSE of 2.11 seconds.",

The internal structure of the software included blobs (saved content of the files), trees (directory structures mapping names to references to blobs and other trees), and commits (combinations of log messages, other metadata (commit date, author, etc.), a reference to a tree, and references to parent commits). Used cryptographic hash functions like SHA-1, serialization, directory manipulation, graph traversals, and integration tests. The application was built with Java.",

The website has reached over 315K user sessions, 5 million pageviews, and served more than 16.5 million ad impressions during the site’s lifetime. The main sources of traffic were SEO, affiliates, and my own Instagram accounts. I negotiated and built the affiliate network to consist of over 100 affiliates that have a combined following on social media of around 4MM followers. I also worked on optimizing ad revenue by setting up header bidding with multiple different networks/exchanges selling ad space to the highest bidder. Also increased revenue through decreasing website load speed by 220% and yielded a 23.7% increase in pages per session which led to more ad impressions.",

This game involves no element of chance and allows a user to play against a computer or against another person, or to allow the computer to play itself. Implemented the game functionality in Java. The AI was built using the minimax algorithm to decide what is the next best move and alpha-beta pruning to improve the efficiency of the decision making process. Connected the backend to a graphical interface (GUI) that was implemented using Graphics2D. Used JUnit for both unit and integration testing.",

            "description": "Enigma machines were devices that Germany used during World War II to encrypt its military communications. This project involves building a simulated version of this machine. My software takes descriptions of possible initial configurations through cyclic permutations, rotors, ringstellung, and plugboards to encode or decode messages (the Enigma algorithms are reciprocal, meaning that encryption is its own inverse operation). For example, the phrase “HELLO THERE” would be encoded into “XJFXZ KPVZP” with a specific set of settings. Notice how the same letters (in this case “E” and “L”) can have different letters in the encoding. This makes the cipher very difficult to break.",

The accounts reach a combined 24 million+ sports fans and 650k+ content interactions through posts every month. Using the accounts, I was able to create multiple streams of income and optimize traffic funneling. After strategizing and developing my own methods to increase followers, likes, and engagement, I was able to develop an automated content curation process to grow the accounts exponentially with minimal effort. Used Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to build a model that predicts how well a post will perform with 70.59% precision. This allowed me to determine what content to post and optimize growth. I also explored and analyzed accounts posting schedule and post type yielding a 56.63% increase in engagement.",
