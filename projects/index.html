We worked with multiple datasets from different sources in order to cluster data spatially using Google Plus Codes and census tract geojson to perform analysis on the impact COVID lockdown had on traffic in San Francisco.

It has reached over 315K users, 5M pageviews, and served more than 16.5M ad impressions during the site's lifetime. The website was built using NextJS with Typescript and TailwindCSS. Since the website queries data that changes often from a MongoDB instance, incremental static regeneration was implemented to keep the site up to date. The quiz application of the website was separately built from the main site and is a MERN fullstack application built from scratch. The frontend portion of the website was built with ReactJS and vanilla CSS. Axios was used to fetch quiz data from the backend API. The backend portion of the website was built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. The Mongoose library was used to do CRUD operations in the MongoDB instance.

This project involves building a simulated version of this machine. My software takes descriptions of possible initial configurations through cyclic permutations, rotors, ringstellung, and plugboards to encode or decode messages (the Enigma algorithms are reciprocal, meaning that encryption is its own inverse operation). For example, the phrase “HELLO THERE” would be encoded into “XJFXZ KPVZP” with a specific set of settings. Notice how the same letters (in this case “E” and “L”) can have different letters in the encoding. This makes the cipher very difficult to break.</h2><h2 class="technology">Java, JUnit</h2><h2 class="more"><div>Contact for code</div></h2></div></div><div class="singleproject"><div class="logo"><img src="/projectImages/hoop.webp" width="150px"></div><div class="text"><h1>HoopOriginals & DunkVintage</h1><h2 class="more">Started two Instagram accounts in the basketball niche and grew both accounts to over 110k+ and 35k+ followers.

Using the accounts, I was able to create multiple streams of income and optimize traffic funneling. After strategizing and developing my own methods to increase followers, likes, and engagement, I was able to develop an automated content curation process to grow the accounts exponentially with minimal effort. Used Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to build a model that predicts how well a post will perform with 70.59% precision. This allowed me to determine what content to post and optimize growth. I also explored and analyzed accounts posting schedule and post type yielding a 56.63% increase in engagement.</h2><h2 class="technology">Python, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Beautiful Soup</h2><h2 class="more"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hooporiginals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HoopOriginals</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dunkvintage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DunkVintage</a></h2></div></div><div class="singleproject"><div class="logo"><img src="/projectImages/nba.webp" width="150px"></div><div class="text"><h1>NBA Hall of Fame Predictions</h1><h2 class="more">Predicted NBA Hall of Fame status with 95.8% accuracy.
